## Phase 1: Local File-Based Editor

**Objective:** Create a simple, single-page web application for a non-technical user to add text and media content, and then save the output as a self-contained `index.html` file.

**Implementation History:**

1.  **Initial Concept:** The project started as a simple form that saved content to the browser's local storage. This was identified as flawed because the content was not shareable.
2.  **V1 - "Write-Only" Editor:** The application was modified to allow a user to add multiple blocks of content (text and media). The "Save" button would then generate a clean, static `index.html` file for the user to download and manually upload to GitHub Pages. This version did not preserve the editing interface in the saved file.
3.  **V2 - "Read-Write" Editor:** A major flaw was identified where the saved `index.html` could not be re-edited. The application was significantly overhauled to create a circular workflow:
    *   The user opens their previously downloaded `index.html` to edit.
    *   A `loadContentFromDOM()` function reads the existing content and populates the editor.
    *   The user can append new content to the existing content.
    *   The "Save" button downloads a new `index.html` that contains all the content *and* the full editing application, making the output file itself the input for the next session.

**Code Snapshot:** The final code for this phase is stored in `index.html` and `script.js` as of 2025-08-10.

## Phase 2: Pivot to Decap CMS

**New Requirement (2025-08-10):** The user specified that the manual "download-and-upload" workflow is too complex. The new requirement is for a system that **automates all GitHub commits** in the background after the initial setup. The user should not have to interact with GitHub at all.

**Decision:** The file-based approach cannot meet this requirement due to security and technical limitations (a browser cannot make authenticated Git commits on its own).

**New Plan:** The project will be rebuilt using **Decap CMS** (formerly Netlify CMS). 

*   **Reasoning:** Decap CMS is a Git-based headless CMS that provides a user-friendly editor interface while handling secure GitHub authentication and automated background commits. This directly addresses the new requirements in a standard and secure way.
*   **Next Steps:** Proceed with restructuring the project to integrate Decap CMS.
