## About

HackFate is an independent research initiative focused on post-quantum cryptography, exact integer arithmetic, and chaos mathematics. Founded by Anthony Diaz, our work addresses fundamental problems in computation that have remained unsolved for decades.

## Public Research

### K-Elimination
The first O(k) solution to exact division in Residue Number Systems - a problem unsolved for 60 years. Formally verified in Lean4.

### MYSTIC
Zero-drift weather prediction using exact chaos mathematics. Validated against historical data including Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda.
